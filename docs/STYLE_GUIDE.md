# FinanceAgent Frontend Style Guide

A short north star for UI decisions.

## Product intent

FinanceAgent is a decision interface, not a spreadsheet. It should answer:

1) Where is money going?
2) What changed recently?
3) What can I tighten or lean into?

## Principles

- Action > information
- Trends > snapshots
- Prioritize clarity over completeness
- Categories as steering wheel

## Voice

- Calm, concise, practical
- Neutral, non-moralizing
- Coach-like, not judge-like

Examples:
- “Essentials are steady; wants are drifting upward.”
- “Net cashflow improved vs last month.”
- “One change: raise the takeaway limit by $10/day if you want flexibility.”

## UI priorities

1) Net cashflow + trend
2) Spend by type (wants/essentials/savings)
3) Top categories
4) Recent activity
5) Deep dives

## Anti-goals

- Full bank statement mirror
- Gamified streaks
- Chatty AI coach UI
- Overwhelming dashboard vibes
