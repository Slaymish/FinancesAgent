# IOS App

- Using Swift, native ios app. Code developed on linux, when ready to build, I will pull repo on mac and build/deploy from there.
- Designed to use liquid glass
- Mainly display most content from web page, primary use/focus being inbox page
    - Include streak counter, swipe actions, etc
- Get daily notifications like 'Theres x new transactions to clasify!'
    - Should stick with only *new* transactions, not all time unclasified, to not overwealm user.


## Current ios codebase

- Used `swift package init` in `apps/ios/`
